# Clibo

Clibo repository for the IBM - IEEE challenge, made by CodingVirus team.

This project holds up a platform where people can upload the content that they most like, either to follow up their hobbies, interests or simply to earn some money. They can take personalized classes, do auctions and do proposals with different prices in order to get a streaming class with other users.
